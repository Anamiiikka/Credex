# Developer Log

## Day 1 — 2026-05-06

**Hours worked:** 3

**What I did:**
- Initialized Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router
- Set up shadcn/ui dark theme with Button/Card/Input/Label/Select
- Created GitHub Actions CI — lint + Vitest green from first push
- Built pricing-data.ts with all 8 AI tools and verified source URLs
- Defined TypeScript types for tool entries, audit results, lead records
- Configured Supabase client and .env.local.example
- Scaffolded all required markdown files

**What I learned:**
- Tailwind v4 handles configuration significantly differently than v3. Instead of a `tailwind.config.ts`, it heavily relies on CSS variables and an `@theme inline` directive in `globals.css`. I also had to make sure the CI pipeline used `npm install` instead of `npm ci` because Windows-generated lockfiles with native binary dependencies (like `@emnapi`) throw strict synchronization errors on the Ubuntu GitHub runner.

**Blockers / what I'm stuck on:**
- None right now, the CI lockfile issue was tricky but it's resolved.

**Plan for tomorrow:**
- Build the core audit-engine.ts with plan-fit and savings logic
- Write 5+ unit tests for the audit engine
- Build the spend input form UI with all 8 tools
- Add localStorage persistence for form state
- Reach out to 3 real people for user interviews
